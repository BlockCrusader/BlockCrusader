Heya, BlockCrusader here. I'm a self-taught modder developing mods for Terraria/tModLoader, and am also studying Game Design at college. 
I'm currently in the process of publicly releasing my mods and subsequently preparing them for open-sourcing.
Here on github, you'll be able find any of my mods that have been released and open-sourced.
Anyways, have a good one!
